-Dataset 
(See data folder) 4 datasets broken down by skill position ranging back to 2003.

-Predicting fantasy football scores based on players profile( height, weight, bmi, etc..), workout metrics(speed, accelteration, strength), and college stats.

-After some feature engineering, I will create a linear regression model to predict points scored as well as a clustering algorithm to break players into tiers.
